# Practice Number 1 - Functional Programming in Haskell

This project contains multiple useful mathematical functions, implemented through basic operations in Haskell without relying on external libraries. It is part of a functional programming course with purely educational purposes.

## Program Functionalities

### 1) P3_1_UsefulFunctions
- **removeData.hs**  
  Removes all numbers within a given range `[min, max]` from a list.
  
- **sortArray.hs**  
  Sorts a list of numbers in descending order.  


### 2) P3_2_NumericalMethods
- **cosineFunction.hs**  
  Calculates `cos(x)` by summing a finite number of terms of its series.  

- **exponentialFunction.hs**  
  Calculates `e^x` with a multiple summatory.  

- **naturalLogarithm.hs**  
  Approximates `ln(1 + x)` (valid for `-1 < x â‰¤ 1`).  

### 3) P3_3_DSPT
- **discreteCosine.hs**  
  Implements the **Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)** for a list of data points.

## Problems and errors during the development

### 1) P3_1_UsefulFunctions
- **removeData.hs**  
  - Problems related to what could happen if
    the minimal value was bigger than the max
    one.
  - Deciding wether or not should be used a
    comprehensive list over a basic function
    to make the program
  
- **sortArray.hs**  
   - Finding a proper way to make the cycle
     as this was the first program to be made
   - Understanding how to organize the flow
     of the multiple functions as this program
     required multiple verifications throught
     the execution of the program
   - Recognizing how to swap the multiple
     elements in a proper way

### 2) P3_2_NumericalMethods
- **cosineFunction.hs**  
   - Handling how fast were the numbers increasing
     due to the cosine inside the program because
     these values could return infinite or crash
     the device
   - Organizing the functions to make the main
     function execute properly
   - Making that the tests run properly
- **exponentialFunction.hs**  
   - Problems related to how to divide properly
     the multiple functions involucrated in the
     main function.
   - Problems related to what could happen with
     negative exponents.
   - Problems related to how to include constant
     values without requesting them from users.
   - Problem related about deciding the stopping
     functions for the auxiliar functions.
   - Understanding how to reduce pi properly.
     
- **naturalLogarithm.hs**  
   - Organizing properly the functions.

- **General problems throught the development**
   - Installing all the required components to
     make Haskell compile properly since we
     were using VSC to write and test everything.
   - The high difficulty involved in understanding
     Haskell to develop all the programs since our
     team has not had to deal with functional
     programming ever.
   - Coordinating all the proccess through Github.
     Since we divided the work between all members
     coordinating how to use the tool appropiately
     to evite fatal mistakes was really important.
   - Time organization and video preparation.
   - Maintaining a clean code throught the entire
     development proccess
### 3) P3_3_DSPT
- **discreteCosine.hs**  
    - Problems related on understanding the needed
      functions for the program as it was very
      complex.
    - Problems related to understanding how to use
      properly the lists for this program.
    - Problem related to deciding how to obtain the
      square root with the basic elements of haskell
      and minimizing the error rate we could obtain.
    - Wether or not was worth using double over float
      to reduce the marginal error we could obtain.
    - How to organize properly the flow of the functions
      to make everything work properly having in mind the
      many functionalities present in the program.
